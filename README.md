# ToDoList-Android-App
:rocket: (my first android app) :rocket:

:coffee: I made a simple android application called todolist app using java language 
and SQLite for the database. for the interface I use materials that are already available free on uplabs.
thank you to Rudi Hartono for giving the adobe xd file for free.

About the application. You can record your daily activities or tasks in this application easily.

next time. I will develop this application with more interactive and functionality.
such as adding notifications, selecting hours or days to a time/date using android time/date picker tool, 
add some color in your card todo, etc. :beer:
